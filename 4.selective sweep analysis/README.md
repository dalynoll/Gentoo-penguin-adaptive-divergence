# Selective sweep Results: nSL and RAiSD

This repository contains scripts and summary files related to genome-wide selection scans performed using **nSL** and **RAiSD**.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, large output files are hosted externally.

## üìù Notes
- All genomic coordinates are based on the reference genome of Gentoo penguin (Genbank access GCA_010090195.1).
- Filtering steps and thresholds are described in `pipeline_selective_sweep(RAiSD_nSL).ipynb`.
